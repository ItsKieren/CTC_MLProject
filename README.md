## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**

### **Two-step setup: First install the prerequisites, then set up the project.**

### **Prerequisites**

#### **Install Dependencies**

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

1. **Install Python (Recommended version v3.10.12)**:
   Install Python on your system from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31012).
   - **Windows users**: Ensure Python is added to your system PATH. If required, follow this guide to [add Python to PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-so-it-finds-my-modules-packages).

   After installation, verify Python is installed correctly by checking the version:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   You should see an output like:
   ```
   Python 3.10.12
   ```

2. **Install Pip (Python Package Installer)**:
   Pip is typically included with Python. To ensure it's installed correctly, run:

   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   If it‚Äôs not installed, follow the instructions on the [Pip installation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

#### **Install Required Libraries**:

Ensure the required libraries for the project are installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### **Setup**

1. **Clone the Project**:

   Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Setup Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):

   Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```


#### **üöÄ Run the Project**

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see three services running:

- **Server**: Runs on `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with your actual port number).
- **Botnet detection**: Monitors network traffic for potential botnet activity.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask server that handles requests and visualizations.

### **üìñ API Documentation**

If your project exposes any APIs, provide a section for the API documentation here. For example:

- **POST /start**: Starts the packet capture and botnet detection.
  - **Request**: Starts the capture process.
  - **Response**: Returns a status message (e.g., `"Capture Started"`).
  
- **POST /stop**: Stops the packet capture.
  - **Request**: Stops monitoring traffic.
  - **Response**: Returns a status message (e.g., `"Capture Stopped"`).

- **GET /download_csv**: Allows the user to download captured network data as a CSV file.
  - **Response**: Provides a downloadable CSV file containing packet information.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/start
```

You can add more details based on your specific routes and API functionality.
